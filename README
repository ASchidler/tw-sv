This is an implementation of the treewidth SAT encoding by Samer and Veith, including common heuristics for
upper and lower bounds.
The encoding can be found in sv.py and some common improvements in sv_improved.py.

The code requires networkx and and minisat in the path.
Then running "solve.py <instance>"" will find the optimal treewidth.

The code is pending major refactoring in the (near) future.

This version also contains the code for threshold-treewidth as proposed in the paper
"Threshold Treewidth and Hypertree Width" (https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/263).
The respective code can be found in the ctw folder.
